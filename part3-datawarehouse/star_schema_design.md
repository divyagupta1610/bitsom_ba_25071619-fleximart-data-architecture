## Section 2: Design Decisions

The fact table uses a transaction line-item level grain to allow detailed analysis of sales at the product level. This granularity enables flexible reporting such as product performance, customer purchasing behavior, and time-based trend analysis.

Surrogate keys are used instead of natural keys to improve performance, maintain historical accuracy, and handle changes in source system identifiers. They also simplify joins and ensure consistency across the data warehouse.

This star schema supports drill-down and roll-up operations effectively. Analysts can roll up data from daily to monthly or yearly levels using the date dimension, and drill down from category-level sales to individual product performance. The simple structure minimizes joins and improves query performance for analytical workloads.
